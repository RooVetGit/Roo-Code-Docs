## Roo Code Tips & Tricks by [@Michaelzag](https://github.com/Michaelzag)

[Roo Code Tips & Tricks](https://github.com/Michaelzag/RooCode-Tips-Tricks) is a collection of files designed to supercharge your Roo Code experience and maximize productivity. For those looking for a memory management system: check out the [Handoff System](https://github.com/Michaelzag/RooCode-Tips-Tricks/blob/main/handoffs/handoff-system.md) which is a simple yet powerful way to maintain optimal LLM performance during extended projects while automatically creating valuable documentation. 

## Roo Code Dynamic Rules by [@cannuri](https://github.com/cannuri)

Inspired by LangMem, this simple Rule allows you to define new rules and delete them on the fly simply by writing `RULE/NORULE: (your new rule)` in your message. Roo Code will then add it to or remove it from the `.clinerules` file. This way you can quickly define project specific rules on the fly and build them up step by step. Check out [Roo Code Dynamic Rules](https://github.com/cannuri/roo-code-dynamic-rules) on Github.
